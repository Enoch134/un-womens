            UN Women is the United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality
            and the empowerment of women. A global champion for women and girls,
            UN Women was established to accelerate progress on meeting their
            needs worldwide. UN Women supports UN Member States as they set
            global standards for achieving gender equality, and works with
            governments and civil society to design laws, policies, programmes
            and services needed to ensure that the standards are effectively
            implemented and truly benefit women and girls worldwide. It works
            globally to make the vision of the Sustainable Development Goals a
            reality for women and girls and stands behind women’s equal
            participation in all aspects of life, focusing on four strategic
            priorities: Women lead, participate in and benefit equally from
            governance systems Women have income security, decent work and
            economic autonomy All women and girls live a life free from all
            forms of violence Women and girls contribute to and have greater
            influence in building sustainable peace and resilience, and benefit
            equally from the prevention of natural disasters and conflicts and
            humanitarian action UN Women also coordinates and promotes the UN
            system’s work in advancing gender equality, and in all deliberations
            and agreements linked to the 2030 Agenda. The entity works to
            position gender equality as fundamental to the Sustainable
            Development Goals, and a more inclusive world. Status of women
            Gender equality is not only a basic human right, but its achievement
            has enormous socio-economic ramifications. Empowering women fuels
            thriving economies, spurring productivity and growth. Yet gender
            inequalities remain deeply entrenched in every society. Women lack
            access to decent work and face occupational segregation and gender
            wage gaps. They are too often denied access to basic education and
            health care. Women in all parts of the world suffer violence and
            discrimination. They are under-represented in political and economic
            decision-making processes. Over many decades, the United Nations has
            made significant progress in advancing gender equality, including
            through landmark agreements such as the Beijing Declaration and
            Platform for Action and the Convention on the Elimination of All
            Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Working for the
            empowerment and rights of women and girls globally, UN Women’s main
            roles are: To support inter-governmental bodies, such as the
            Commission on the Status of Women, in their formulation of policies,
            global standards and norms. To help Member States implement these
            standards, standing ready to provide suitable technical and
            financial support to those countries that request it, and to forge
            effective partnerships with civil society. To lead and coordinate
            the UN system’s work on gender equality, as well as promote
            accountability, including through regular monitoring of system-wide
            progress. Historical perspective For many years, the United Nations
            faced serious challenges in its efforts to promote gender equality
            globally, including inadequate funding and no single recognized
            driver to direct UN activities on gender equality issues. In July
            2010, the United Nations General Assembly created UN Women, the
            United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of
            Women, to address such challenges. In doing so, UN Member States
            took an historic step in accelerating the Organization’s goals on
            gender equality and the empowerment of women. The creation of UN
            Women came about as part of the UN reform agenda, bringing together
            resources and mandates for greater impact. It merges and builds on
            the important work of four previously distinct parts of the UN
            system, which focused exclusively on gender equality and women’s
            empowerment: Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW)
            International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of
            Women (INSTRAW) Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and
            Advancement of Women (OSAGI) United Nations Development Fund for
            Women (UNIFEM)
