          UN Women is the United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality
          and the empowerment of women. A global champion for women and girls,
          UN Women was established to accelerate progress on meeting their
          needs worldwide. UN Women supports UN Member States as they set
          global standards for achieving gender equality, and works with
          governments and civil society to design laws, policies, programmes
          and services needed to ensure that the standards are effectively
          implemented and truly benefit women and girls worldwide. It works
          globally to make the vision of the Sustainable Development Goals a
          reality for women and girls and stands behind women’s equal
          participation in all aspects of life, focusing on four strategic
          priorities: Women lead, participate in and benefit equally from
          governance systems Women have income security, decent work and
          economic autonomy All women and girls live a life free from all
          forms of violence Women and girls contribute to and have greater
          influence in building sustainable peace and resilience, and benefit
          equally from the prevention of natural disasters and conflicts and
          humanitarian action UN Women also coordinates and promotes the UN
          system’s work in advancing gender equality, and in all deliberations
          and agreements linked to the 2030 Agenda. The entity works to
          position gender equality as fundamental to the Sustainable
          Development Goals, and a more inclusive world. Status of women
          Gender equality is not only a basic human right, but its achievement
          has enormous socio-economic ramifications. Empowering women fuels
          thriving economies, spurring productivity and growth. Yet gender
          inequalities remain deeply entrenched in every society. Women lack
          access to decent work and face occupational segregation and gender
          wage gaps. They are too often denied access to basic education and
          health care. Women in all parts of the world suffer violence and
          discrimination. They are under-represented in political and economic
          decision-making processes. Over many decades, the United Nations has
          made significant progress in advancing gender equality, including
          through landmark agreements such as the Beijing Declaration and
          Platform for Action and the Convention on the Elimination of All
          Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Working for the
          empowerment and rights of women and girls globally, UN Women’s main
          roles are: To support inter-governmental bodies, such as the
          Commission on the Status of Women, in their formulation of policies,
          global standards and norms. To help Member States implement these
          standards, standing ready to provide suitable technical and
          financial support to those countries that request it, and to forge
          effective partnerships with civil society. To lead and coordinate
          the UN system’s work on gender equality, as well as promote
          accountability, including through regular monitoring of system-wide
          progress. Historical perspective For many years, the United Nations
          faced serious challenges in its efforts to promote gender equality
          globally, including inadequate funding and no single recognized
          driver to direct UN activities on gender equality issues. In July
          2010, the United Nations General Assembly created UN Women, the
          United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of
          Women, to address such challenges. In doing so, UN Member States
          took an historic step in accelerating the Organization’s goals on
          gender equality and the empowerment of women. The creation of UN
          Women came about as part of the UN reform agenda, bringing together
          resources and mandates for greater impact. It merges and builds on
          the important work of four previously distinct parts of the UN
          system, which focused exclusively on gender equality and women’s
          empowerment: Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW)
          International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of
          Women (INSTRAW) Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and
          Advancement of Women (OSAGI) United Nations Development Fund for
          Women (UNIFEM)
